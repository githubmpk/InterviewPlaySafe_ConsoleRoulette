This is a java application
Run the main class, it will trigger every 30 seconds a spin based on users available and their bets as per rouletteplayers text file under resources.

Note:
This reads up a file and triggers timer.
A little different than what is specified in pdf, I can refactor this to command line input.
But I feel this is more user friendly.

Please let me know if you want me to refactor. This should be an additional 10 minutes task. I'm leaving this due to time constraints
